# RP Todo

This is me learning how to make a Python CLI tool.

I worked from [this blog post](https://realpython.com/python-typer-cli/)

## Things I learned

- Setting up `python` to point to a versioned Python installation, from here <https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac>
- `python -m` indicates which module to run `The -m stands for module-name in Python. The module name should be valid in Python`
- Tests needs to be prefixed with `test_` to be picked up by `python -m pytest tests/`
